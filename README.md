# Stellar-Orbits
Plots of various stellar orbits around Sgr. A*. 

The file 'Plots-of-Stellar-Orbits-Around-SMBH.py' is a Pyhton-written code that allows the user to plot datapoints 
and their respective errors in a Cartesian Coordinate system with the Super Massive Black Hole (abb. SMBH)
placed at origo. The data collected is put into Excel and it originates from Gillessen et al. 
An Update on Monitorinig Stellar Orbits in the Galactic Center.

The file 'KeplerOrbitS2NoSMBHMovement.py' is a Python-written code that allows the user to plot datapoints for the orbit of S2 and their respective errors in a Cartesian Coordiante system with the SMBH placed at origo. The code performs a fit to the data based on Keplerian Orbit theory and carries out a reduced chisq test alongside an estimation of the parameters: M_SMBH, R_0, (omega, Omega, I) [orbital elements] and the eccentricity, apicenter and the time spent closest to the SMBH.

The file 'KeplerOrbitS4716NoSMBHMovement.py' is a Python-written code that allows the user to plot datapoints for the orbit of S4716 and their respective errors in a Cartesian Coordiante system with the SMBH placed at origo. The code performs a fit to the data based on Keplerian Orbit theory and carries out a reduced chisq test alongside an estimation of the parameters: M_SMBH, R_0, (omega, Omega, I) [orbital elements] and the eccentricity, apicenter and the time spent closest to the SMBH. Please note, this code results in a chisq value between 100-200.
