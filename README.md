# Stellar-Orbits
Plots of various stellar orbits around Sgr. A*. 

The file 'Plots-of-Stellar-Orbits-Around-SMBH.py' is a Pyhton-written code that allows the user to plot datapoints 
and their respective errors in a Cartesian Coordinate system with the Super Massive Black Hole (abb. SMBH)
placed at origo. The data collected is put into Excel and it originates from Gillessen et al. 
An Update on Monitorinig Stellar Orbits in the Galactic Center.

The file 'MultipleOrbitData.xlsx' contains the data used in 'Plots-of-Stellar-Orbits-Around-SMBH.py'
